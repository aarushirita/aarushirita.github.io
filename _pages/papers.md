  <p>
Personalization algorithms have been linked to online echo chambers as they feed belief-confirming information to social media users. However, evidence on algorithms and user behavior jointly shaping harmful engagement is limited. In this paper, I conduct an individually randomized experiment with 5 million users replacing the feed-ranking algorithm with random content delivery on a prominent TikTok-like platform in India. Given the prevalence of hateful content targeting minority groups on Indian social media, I focus on this issue and establish a trade-off: random post recommendation lowers exposure to anti-minority (''toxic'') content by 27%, but at a substantial cost to the platform as overall platform usage falls by 35%. Strikingly, treated users share a larger proportion of the toxic posts they view, mitigating the decline in the number of toxic posts shared from the platform. Users with a higher interest in toxic content at baseline drive this result as they seek out content the algorithm does not show them. I rationalize these findings with a model of a revenue-driven algorithm that faces heterogeneous users choosing which posts to consume. Model-based counterfactuals evaluate alternative interventions that target toxicity in the algorithm's recommendations. Finally, I collect survey evidence to trace users' online behavior beyond the platform and show that the most affected users spend more time on substitute platforms. These results underscore the limits of piecemeal algorithmic regulation.
