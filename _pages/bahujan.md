## Bahujan Economists

I am among the co-founders of [Bahujan Economists](https://bahujanecon.org/), a platform for researchers, aspirants, students, and professors from the historically marginalized caste, tribes, and religious communities in Economics.

You can follow our work [here](https://x.com/BahujanEcon).
