I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University. My Research Interests lie at the intersection of Development and Public Economics.Broadly, my research aims to understand the causes and consequences of inequality, and segregation across difference social groups, with the aim of designing technology policies for creating less polarized digital spaces.

My Job Market Paper studies the drivers of socially undesireable behavior on social media, assessing the role of exposure to toxic content via recommendation algorithms in reinforcing existing behavioral patterns. I conducted a large-scale experiment randomizing exposure to social media posts for a million treated users of a popular social media platform in India. My research employs Experimental Methods, Machine Learning for Data Analysis (including Text Analysis), as well as Structural Modeling.

I am also a co-founder of *Bahujan Economists*, a platform for students of Economics belonging to marginalized communities in India to collaborate and support each other, inside and outside the academic world. Along with an attempt to increase representation of historically disadvantaged groups in research, the platformâ€™s objective is also to put forward community's perspectives in building academic understanding of inter-group inequality.
