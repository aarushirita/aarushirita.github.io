I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University. My Research Interests lie at the intersection of Development and Political Economics. I also develop Machine Learning methods to answer questions of causal inference in observational studies. 

My current research studies the causes of hate speech and political polarization on social media. I do this using Big Data from a hugely popular content generation platform in India. Broadly, I interrogate economic causes of communal conflict and political polarization in the South Asian context. 

I am also a co-founder of *Bahujan Economists*, a platform for students of Economics belonging to marginalized communities in India to collaborate and support each other, inside and outside the academic world. Along with an attempt to increase our representation in research, the groupâ€™s objective is also to put forward our perspectives that have largely been absent until now from the field. BE hopes to create a space in Economics that is inclusive of historically oppressed communities in India. We have organized sessions that will help students from marginalized backgrounds in the job market as well as research. We have conducted Python, Statistics and Stata classes, English speaking support sessions, for bahujan students. The aim is to equip students with tools that would help them academically and to provide guidance to students from the community.
