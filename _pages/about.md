I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University. I am interested in Development, Political Economy, and the Economics of Digital Platforms/ AI. My research examines how social identity drives segregation and exclusion in both digital and physical environments, analyzing their impact on development processes by limiting political participation of disadvantaged groups in societies marked by inequality.

I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.
