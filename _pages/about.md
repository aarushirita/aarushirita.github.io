I am an applied microeconomist focussing on digital economies and AI in under-regulated environments. My research examines how social identity drives exclusion both online and offline.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Department of Economics and Nuffield College, Oxford University. I completed my PhD from Brown in 2025.
