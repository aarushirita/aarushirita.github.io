I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University. My Research Interests lie at the intersection of Development and Political Economics. I also develop Machine Learning methods to answer questions of causal inference in observational settings. 

My current research studies the causes of hate speech and political polarization on social media. Broadly, I interrogate economic causes of conflict and political polarization in the South Asia. 

I am also a co-founder of *Bahujan Economists*, a platform for students of Economics belonging to marginalized communities in India to collaborate and support each other, inside and outside the academic world. Along with an attempt to increase representation of historically disadvantaged groups in research, the platformâ€™s objective is also to put forward community's perspectives that have largely been absent until now from the field.
