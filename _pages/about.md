I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University. I am interested in Development, Political Economy, and the Economics of Digital Platforms/ AI. 

My research examines how social identity drives segregation and exclusion in both digital and physical environments, analyzing their impact on development processes by limiting political participation in unequal societies.
