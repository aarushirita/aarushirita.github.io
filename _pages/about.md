I am an applied microeconomist researching the digital economy in under-regulated environments. Broadly, my research examines how social identity drives exclusion both online and offline, and analyzes its impact on economic development.

I will be a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford starting in September 2025.
