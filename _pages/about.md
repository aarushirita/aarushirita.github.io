I am an applied microeconomist researching the digital economy in under-regulated environments. My fields are development and political economy.

Broadly, my research examines how social identity drives segregation and exclusion in both digital and physical environments, and analyzing the impact on development processes.

I will be a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford starting in September 2025.
